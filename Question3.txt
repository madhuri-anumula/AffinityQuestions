Question: Which web tool has impressed you the most and why?
Pinterest- One of the fatest growing/used platforms for online content sharing.
I like the way, it brings together people with similar interests.
Also it's a great way of expressing/exploring wide range of interests
from sharing photos,quotatios,boards etc.
User interface for creating amd sharing interests through board pins is simple,unique and engaging.
