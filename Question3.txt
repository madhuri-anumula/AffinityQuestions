Question: Which web tool has impressed you the most and why?

Pinterest - One of the fastest growing/used platforms for online content sharing.
I like the way it brings together people with similar interests.
Using boards and pins with photos,quotatios etc. expressing interests with followers/comments
is innovative,enganging and nice!
