Javascript has many frameworks,tools and libraries like Angular,React,Vue.js,ember.js and
 more each offering a few advantages over its peers.
 

Following key aspects might aid in identifying the appropriate framework.

1) Project complexity,team size and duration should be considered while deciding on 
the framework.

2) Avalability of learning resources and popularity(github stars,developer base) of framework
will help us in pooling skilled programmers. It's important for having a efficient team.

2) Core features - Identyfying core requirements of project and weighing with the available
  framework support will help us in meeting functional/non-functional requirements better.

3)Usability - as application scales up, picking framework which is developer friendly will be key to project success.

support for integration/extendability becomes important factor too.
