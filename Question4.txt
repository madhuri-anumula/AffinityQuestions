Javascript has many frameworks,tools and libraries like Angular,React,Vue.js,ember.js and more. each offering
a few advantages over its peers.Working on a small project or a large one, solo or in a team,all of these
details should be considered while deciding on the framework.

Following key aspects might aid in identifying the appropriate framework.

1) Avalability of learning resources and polularity(github stars,developer base) indirectly
help us in pooling skilled programmers.
2) Core features - Identyfying core requiremnts of project and weighing with the
  framework support.
3)Usability - as application scales up, picking framework which is developer friendly might be helpful.
